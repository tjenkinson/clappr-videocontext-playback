# clappr-videocontext-playback
A clappr playback for the BBC's video context tool.

This is a proof-of-concept to integrate the BBC's video context tool with [clappr](https://github.com/clappr/clappr) as a playback.

I have tweaked Clappr slightly to make this work (hance why clappr is in the demo folder) but will be submitting PR's with those changes.

Checkout the demo in the demo folder or at http://tjenkinson.me/clappr-videocontext-playback
